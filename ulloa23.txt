Open Source allows an ulimited amount of coders to come together and improve their skills by learning and teaching.
This in turn helps improve technologies that will hopefully provide a better quality of life than before the technology was introduced, whether it be a service type application or entertainment type. The goal is always to improve human life, right? 
I would like to think so. (:
