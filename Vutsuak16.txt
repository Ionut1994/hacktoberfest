I am a FOSS enthusiast because:

1. I see brilliant projects absolutely free
2. I can work with top developers round the globe and include them in my projects too
3. Excellent way for version control
4. Gives the satisfcation of contributing to a community
5. Makes me feel very cool with all the T-shirts and goodies one gets at OpenSource conferences and programs
