// Why I love open source

I'm actually new to the world of open source and to programming. From what I've seen so far of open source though, it is exciting.
I'm excited to be able to collaborate with people way smarter than me and to learn from them.
I'm excited to build stuff!
I'm excited to be able to give back to a community that is so willing to help me.
