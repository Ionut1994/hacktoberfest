Open source is magical concept. It allows anyone and
everyone to transparently see what goes into a project.
If I'm interested in GPU programming, I can browse
hundreds of open sourced projects that have already
implemented such a thing and I can learn from their
experience. To go even further, I could contribute to
the project, I could download the project on as
many machines as I want, and I can share the project
with anyone I please. Open source is truely a magical
thing and if anything or anyone were to try and stop it,
they'd be doing all developers a disservice.
