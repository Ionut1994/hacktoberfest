# Why I Love Open Source

# Open source is a wonderful platform for members of the global community of programmers/developers/enthusiasts alike can
# contribute to any project they choose. Rather than developing a small team to tackle such project, this allows for the 
# global community to be team, which can lead to a far better outcome and more efficient process of the project. Thank you 
# for the opportunity to gain a PR!
