Why do I love open source? Well, imagine a world without them. Imagine a world without alternatives to closed source programms where you have to pay huge sums of money without the chance of tweaking, playing around, helping and improving the programm, would you like to live on that world? This is why I love open source programms, nothing is better than being able to download an alternative programm for free and even helping at improving it and modding it.
