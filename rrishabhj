I love open source for so many reasons. The power to change our world and improve the lives and businesses of people I 
would never otherwise meet is almost breath-taking. Stop and think about it for a second. The power to help others and 
provide a sense of empowerment to someone else is yours. 
Your open source activities empower you to find both personal and professional satisfaction.This is a hobby for some people, believe it or not.Gillette will be happy to give you a free razor and sell you the blades.
Some people make money in other ways and want to give back to the community. I'm sure Linus Torvalds has made plenty of money 'off' of Linux without actually selling the code and probably turns money away.
Not all open source software was intended or designed for any user to just download, install and use, so you may end up spending more of your time depending on skill level and most people value their time.
